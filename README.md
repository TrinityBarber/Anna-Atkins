**Anna Atkins**
<br><br>
Anna Atkins was a British botanist and photographer born on the 16 March 1799, in Tonbridge, and died on the 9 June 1871, in Halstead Place. Anna married John Pelly Atkins in 1825. Due to her mother’s death when she was young, Anna become close to her father, John George Children, who was a respected scientist.
Anna had first worked with her father, in her early 20’s illustrating her father’s translation of Genera of Shells, by Jean Baptiste de Lamarck. Although scientific work was mostly inaccessible to women of the time, due to her father’s link to Royal Sociality and his work at the British Museum she was able to have access to work within botany, as well as due to botany being more open to women than other sciences.

With Anna’s fathers link to the Royal Society, she was well acquainted with William henry fox talbot and Sir John Herschel, the inventor of the calotype processes, used famously by Anna Atkins in botany studies, and the photographic process. Anna was gifted a camera in 1841, although none of the photos taken with the camera has survived. Though calotype was of greater interest to Anna, as she implemented calotype into her work in botany, making calotype prints of plants. Anna later self-published these works in 1843 in her book Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions.

Anna had become the first person to develop a book with photographic images through the use of her calotypes. Not only that, but Anna also catalogued an extensive range of algae and other plants, notably producing three volumes of her book, and supplying specimens to Kew Gardens for a renowned botanist. Books published by Anna are rare as they were published personally and then distributed to the recipients who then bound them themselves. The Horniman is an example of this, being bound into 4 books for each volume that only has seventeen copies that still exist, these being held in places such as the British Library, the Royal Society and Kew Gardens.
