**Anna Atkins**
<br><br>
Anna Atkins was a British botanist and photographer born on the 16 March 1799, in Tonbridge, and died on the 9 June 1871, in Halstead Place. Anna married John Pelly Atkins in 1825. Due to her mother’s death when she was young, Anna become close to her father, John George Children, who was a respected scientist.
Anna had first worked with her father, in her early 20’s illustrating her father’s translation of Genera of Shells, by Jean Baptiste de Lamarck. Although scientific work was mostly inaccessible to women of the time, due to her father’s link to Royal Sociality and his work at the British Museum she was able to have access to work within botany, as well as due to botany being more open to women than other sciences.
